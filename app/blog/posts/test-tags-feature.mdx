### Test Article

This is a test article created to verify that:

1. Tags are displayed correctly on the `/thoughts` page
2. Thumbnails appear on the right side (desktop only)
3. Tags are clickable and navigate to `/tags/[tag]` pages
4. The tag system works end-to-end

If you can see tags like "Next.js", "TypeScript", and "Testing" displayed as badges below the title, then the implementation is working correctly!
